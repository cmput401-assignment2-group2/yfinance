**INTRODUCTION**

**Requirement(s) to be tested:** Identify the requirements to be tested and include the requirement number and description from the Requirements Traceability Matrix.

**Roles and Responsibilities:** Describe each project team member and stakeholder involved in the test, and identify their associated responsibility for ensuring the test is executed appropriately.

**Set Up Procedures:** Describe the sequence of actions necessary to prepare for execution of the test.

**Stop Procedures:** Describe the sequence of actions necessary to terminate the test.

**ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS**

**Hardware:** Identify the qualities and configurations of the hardware required to execute the test case.

**Software:** Identify system and application software required to execute the test case. Specify any software that the test case will interact with.

**Procedural Requirements:** Describe any constraints on the test procedures necessary to execute the test case.

**TEST**

**Test Items and Features:** Identify and describe the items and features that will be exercised by the test case. Group the test cases into

logically related scenarios that test related items and features. For each item or feature, a reference to its

associated requirement source should be included.

**Input Specifications:** Define each input required to execute the test case, and reference any required relationships between inputs.

**Procedural Steps:** Describe the sequences of actions necessary to prepare and execute the test case. Provide detailed test

procedures for each test case; explain precisely how each test case will be executed.

**Expected Results of Case:** Describe the outcome anticipated from the test case. Specify the criteria to be used to determine whether the item has passed or failed.

**ACTUAL RESULTS**

**Output Specifications:** Define all of the outputs and features required of the test case and provide expected values. While executing the

test, record and describe the visually observable outputs as they occur. Produce tangible evidence of the output

such as a screen print. At the conclusion, describe the actual outcome. Indicate whether the test passed or failed,

and identify any discrepancies between the expected results and the actual results.
